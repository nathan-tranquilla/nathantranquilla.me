      I'm on a mission to shape the next generation of web development.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-700 lg:text-base">
      My journey began at BlueSpurs, a small startup where I built my first site
      in PHP for a local newspaper—discovering that perfect blend of art and
      logic. As JavaScript frameworks evolved, I eagerly embraced each wave:
      Backbone for better structure, then React and Angular as they
      revolutionized the frontend landscape, eventually crafting fast, intuitive
      dashboards that consistently impressed both teams and clients.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-700 lg:text-base">
      But success bred clarity. The deeper I went, the more I realized something
      was fundamentally wrong. I was spending more time fighting the tools than
      building solutions. What should have felt like mastery felt like
      constantly working around limitations. I began to see that we weren't
      solving problems—we were just getting better at managing chaos.
    </p>
    <p class="row-start-1 col-start-1 col-end-2 mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-gray-700 lg:text-base">
      Now I'm leveraging years of React mastery and deep JavaScript expertise to
      pioneer Next Gen Web Development. Every lesson learned debugging complex
      state management, every insight from building scalable applications, every
      hard-won understanding of JavaScript's quirks—I'm channeling it all into
      defining a more robust, reliable, and delightful future for web
      development.
