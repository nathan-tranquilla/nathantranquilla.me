      Vision of Next-Gen Web Dev
    </H2>
    <p class="col-start-1 row-start-2 font-sans text-white">
      Next-Gen Web Dev aims for reliable, more maintainable web applications free from
      preventable errors. It requires a shift to robust, strongly typed
      languages that eliminate entire classes of bugs, ensuring developers trust
      their tools and users trust their apps.

      The current status quo
    </H2>
    <p class="col-start-1 col-start-2 row-start-2 font-sans">
      JavaScript’s weak typing, implicit coercions, and runtime errors make it
      challenging for modern web development. TypeScript, while an improvement,
      describes itself as <i>unsound</i>; it lacks complete null safety, 
      allows implicit conversions in some cases, and misses exhaustive type checking. 
      Additionally, its type system requires frequent use of <i>undefined</i> 
      to model JavaScript's reality, indicating a lack of expressiveness. These limitations make it suboptimal for 
      mission-critical server-side (SSR) or client-side (CSR) applications. 
      The web needs languages that guarantee correctness, not just suggest it.

      The Components Of Next-Gen Web Dev

    <InfoCard
      title="Strong Static Typing"
      link="/blogs/strong-type-systems-are-required-for-a-safer-web"
    >
      <p>
        A strong, static type system prevents entire categories of runtime errors by
        catching mistakes at compile-time. Unlike JavaScript's weak typing or
        TypeScript's compromises, truly strong type systems eliminate null pointer
        exceptions, array bounds errors, and type coercion surprises, and are expressive 
        enough to model the current complexity of the web. Static typing means
        fewer bugs, safer refactoring, and increased developer confidence.
        Strong type systems serve as living documentation, making code self-explanatory
        and maintainable. For Next-Gen Web Dev, strong typing isn't
        optional—it's the foundation of reliable software.
      </p>
    </InfoCard>
    <InfoCard title="Familiarity & Interoperability">
      <p>
        Developers choose new languages that look familiar but fix critical
        problems. TypeScript's existence indicates a strong trend towards static typing
        in front-end codebases with the goal of safer, more maintainable code, even at the 
        cost of complexity. Next-Gen Web Dev languages acknowledge both this goal and the 
        embededness of the JavaScript ecosystem in web dev, and offer solutions without 
        abandoning neither the familiarity of JavaScript nor it's ecosystem. 
      </p>
    </InfoCard>
    <InfoCard title="Web Readiness">
      <p>
        Strong, static type systems alone aren't enough. Next-Gen languages need mature
        framework ecosystems for real-world adoption. A language becomes viable
        when it offers full-stack solutions: routing, state management, data
        fetching, and UI libraries. Framework readiness means developers can
        build complete applications without sacrificing type safety or reverting
        to JavaScript. Languages like ReScript with React integration, or Elm
        with its architecture, demonstrate how type-safe languages can provide
        comprehensive development platforms that rival traditional web
        frameworks.
      </p>
    </InfoCard>
    <InfoCard title="Gradual Adoption">
      <p>
        Next-Gen languages excel at gradual adoption. TypeScript's approach to gradual 
        adoption is to adjust the level of typing in the codebase, leaving gaps in the type system,
        depending on compiler configuration. Next-Gen Web Dev languages provide fully sound type 
        systems yet still offer solutions for gradual adoption in the codebase. Next-Gen Web Dev 
        languages do not compromise the type system, but grow in their presence in the codebase.
