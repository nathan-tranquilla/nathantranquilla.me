In today's job market, the job search consumes your time and energy with a low probability of success. Your time is consumed searching for jobs, writing cover letters, adjusting your resume, going through interviews, doing take-home exams, and thinking endlessly about how it went. The emotional rollercoaster is exhausting—you can lose whole weeks with just a single interview process. You may even arrive on the job already burnt out from applying! Worse, you are likely to accept a job you hate out of desperation. But what alternative is there? 

When it was my turn to join the job market, I felt overwhelmed. I knew the market was challenging for software developers, and I hoped the hype on LinkedIn and other social media platforms was exaggerated. However, I knew three developers personally who had suffered through this tough market. One searched for 8 months as a mid-level engineer; he was highly specialized, which is why I believed he suffered the shortest time. Another senior went 1.5 years without work, with significant mental wear. A third shared that he had gone through 10 final rounds before being selected, many with flimsy excuses such as "enthusiasm about the product". 

While my brain made the logical decision to pursue the job search, my body disagreed, having a visceral and uncontrollable response to the gauntlet software developers must go through to get employment. Having gone through 3 burnouts in my career, my body has kept score, and I now acknowledge that I can't endure another. 

Furthermore, in a market downturn where pay has dropped, I find myself prioritizing other parts of job satisfaction over pay. Money matters, and when it flows, it's easier to endure tough colleagues or problems I'm unenthusiastic about. But once it stopped flowing, the other parts of job satisfaction have become more important to me: the people and the problem. 

Even in this market, this has led me to turn down at least one job and cut another process short. Crazy, but it makes sense. Here is a tough truth: when markets are down, it can drive me to become pickier, essentially narrowing my options even further. 

I've come to accept this as a fact for me personally. I can do a lot with 8 months to a year and a half of time. The job search, along with the investment of my time thinking and recovering from the search, is significant and is a distraction from what I *could* be doing with my time otherwise. Furthermore, each interview is an investment that is completely lost if it fails; it's not transferable, it doesn't build equity. The only thing I get better at is... interviewing. 

What if my time could be spent building equity in my own business that builds with every deposit of my energy? How much time would I need to start seeing a return in something I love doing vs. the time I need to land a job that I'm sort-of happy about? What is the return on that business over 3 years and how does that measure up to the job I took at a pay-cut?

I've decided to take my years of software experience and focus it on one thing: defining the next generation of web development. My love for web development, and thoughts on its future, position me uniquely as a software consultant on YouTube. It's a business that, though slow growing, does so with each deposit of time and energy. Furthermore, it's something that pumps me up because I enjoy it and it's my own. 

And now I put the question to you! What could you do with a year of your time? You have that opportunity now. Go for it!
