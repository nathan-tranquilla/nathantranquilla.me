Coding with AI can be a superpower, taking your productivity to a whole new level, but if you’re not careful it will quietly cost you far more time than it saves. So in this video, I’m going to show you the 4 mistakes you must avoid when coding with AI, and the 4 fixes that actually let you use it properly, leading to the core insight you need to unlock productive and frictionless coding with AI.

My name is Nathan Tranquilla, and I have been a software developer for 14 years, and coding with AI since its inception. Let’s get into it.

### What it looks like to lose control of your AI assistant

Here is a scenario you might find yourself in. You're trying to write code in an unfamiliar
scenario, a new language or a new library that you don't yet understand. You know the outcome you
want but you're unfamiliar with the details of how to get there. You ask AI, broadly speaking, to
code towards the desired outcome. Suddenly your IDE has been completely taken over with so much
code, you don't understand what's been written, you can't follow along, and you know you're glossing
over details that might be important to understand. It seems close, but not quite there. You ask AI
to make changes, and spend the next hour in a loop that AI can't seem to resolve.

So what went wrong in this scenario? Let me break down 4 critical mistakes:

#### Mistake 1: Lacking a mental model for the solution

The core issue in this scenario is insufficient understanding of the problem space. When we don't
have a well-developed mental model, we naturally default to giving AI broad, vague instructions.
This leads to AI generating more code than we can effectively review and understand. Signs that this
is happening include: getting overwhelmed by the volume of AI output, finding yourself glossing over
important details, and trying to push through problems without fully grasping the underlying issues.
Without a clear mental model, we can't provide the incremental guidance that AI needs to be
effective. Without this foundation, we naturally struggle to provide adequate constraints in our
prompts.

#### Mistake 2: Not providing enough constraints

Without sufficient understanding of the problem space, it's difficult to provide detailed guidance
to AI. As a result, AI interprets broad instructions as a mandate to make widespread changes. The
breadth and speed of these changes can become overwhelming, making it hard to manage the details.
When we sense that important details need attention but lack the upfront understanding to identify
them, we can know that a lack of detailed constraints is the cause. When we can't constrain the
problem, it is probably because we lack clear technical direction.

#### Mistake 3: Not already having an opinion

Without a clear opinion on how the task should be completed, it becomes difficult to effectively
critique AI output. This leads to accepting large volumes of code without proper review and pushing
forward with solutions even when the AI is clearly stuck on issues that require human insight. This
lack of direction quickly depletes our most crucial resource: mental energy.

#### Mistake 4: Not having enough mental energy

Mental energy is essential for effective AI collaboration. AI amplifies our thought processes. When
our thinking is unclear or underdeveloped, the resulting code will reflect that same lack of
clarity. In a world demanding immediate results, AI still requires careful, well-thought-out
mental processes that lead to high-quality solutions.

### High-Quality AI-assisted coding

Now that we know what went wrong, how do we take back control of our AI-assistant?

#### Solution 1: Ensure you have enough energy to devote to the problem (Solves Mistake #4)

Having sufficient mental energy is probably the most important factor for high-quality interactions
with AI. AI amplifies your thoughts; if provided with low-resolution inputs, it will provide
low-quality outputs. It's as simple as that. With this mental clarity, you can now focus on
manageable scope.

#### Solution 2: Start with small problems (Solves Mistake #3)

Give your AI assistant small fragments to work on. This keeps you from getting overwhelmed or from
missing important details. Small problems mean digestible outputs; you will have the time to
critique and give feedback. Give it small functions to craft, or single tests to write. The smaller
you start, the more likely you are to strike the right balance between the time and energy you save
by crafting a good prompt, and the results you get. Small problems naturally lead to better prompting
skills.

#### Solution 3: Craft detailed constraints (Solves Mistake #2)

Giving your AI assistant detailed constraints will result in lower volume and higher quality output.
When you craft your prompt with detailed constraints, you are less likely to find yourself glossing
over details and pushing AI through problems you don't quite understand. Having a detailed prompt is
a sign that you know the problem space well and can save time by getting AI to generate code without
much fuss. Once you can craft detailed constraints, you're ready for the final step.

#### Solution 4: Use AI to do things you know well (Solves Mistake #1)

Once you have 80-90% of a particular task figured out, you should get AI to complete it. At this
point, it's grunt work, and you should save your time and energy for the _thinking_, not the
_doing_. This touches on the **core insight** of AI-assisted development: **the best AI-assisted
developers get AI to write things they already know how to do, accelerating their development with
minimal friction**.

### Final thoughts

AI-assisted developers can be a real powerhouse of productivity. In my opinion, the best developers
devote their time and energy to thinking clearly about small problems with detailed constraints,
unburdening themselves of tasks they already know how to do very well.
