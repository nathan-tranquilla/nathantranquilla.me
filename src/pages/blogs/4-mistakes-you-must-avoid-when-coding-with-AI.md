AI-assisted programming is like walking an energetic dog; if you lose control of the leash, then you
lose control of the walk. The problem isn't AI, it's how you're using it. Here are 4 mistakes you
must avoid to keep control of your AI assistant, and 4 counter-examples of high-quality AI-assisted
coding.

### What it looks like to lose control of your AI assistant

Here is a scenario you might find yourself in. You're trying to write code in an unfamiliar
scenario, a new language or a new library that you don't yet understand. You know the outcome you
want but you're unfamiliar with the details of how to get there. You ask AI, broadly speaking, to
code towards the desired outcome. Suddenly your IDE has been completely taken over with so much
code, you don't understand what's been written, you can't follow along, and you know you're glossing
over details that might be important to understand. It seems close, but not quite there. You ask AI
to make changes, and spend the next hour in a loop that AI can't seem to resolve.

So what went wrong in this scenario? Let me break down 4 critical mistakes:

#### Mistake 1: Lacking a mental model for the solution

What did you do wrong in this scenario? Broadly speaking, you don't have enough understanding of the
problem. At the root of this scenario is an abdication of responsibility. It is the developer's
responsibility to have a sufficiently developed mental model of the problem to start guiding the AI
assistant in a more incremental manner towards the desired outcome. This scenario is full of signs
that your understanding isn't quite there: you get more input from AI than you can process, you find
yourself glossing over details, and you try to push AI through the problem, despite being stuck,
without realizing there might be core issues that need your attention. Not having a sufficiently
developed mental model will naturally lead you to the next point.

#### Mistake 2: Not providing enough constraints

You didn't give your AI assistant enough constraints because you don't yet understand the problem
sufficiently to give it more detailed guidance. As a result, it has interpreted your inputs as being
given a broad mandate to make widespread changes to your code. The breadth and speed of these
changes has resulted in you being overwhelmed and unable to manage the details. In this scenario,
you're beginning to suspect that there are details that need your attention, but you haven't put in
enough up-front effort to understand what the details should look like, which leads to the next
point.

#### Mistake 3: Not already having an opinion

Without having an opinion, you can't be prepared to critique what the AI assistant writes. This is
what causes you to gloss over the volume of input received, and accept it without critique. This is
also what causes you to push the AI assistant to complete the objective, even though it is clearly
stuck on code issues that need your attention. But you can't provide it with your attention because
of the next point.

#### Mistake 4: Not having enough mental energy

You need mental energy to pair program with your AI assistant. AI is a tool that amplifies your
thoughts. If your thoughts are of poor quality, being underdeveloped or not communicated clearly in
prompts, then you can be sure that the code your assistant writes will be of equally poor quality.
In a world that wants results right now from engineers, AI still needs the careful, well-thought-out
mental processes of developers to guide it towards high-quality code.


### High-Quality AI-assisted coding

Now that we know what went wrong, how do we take back control of our AI-assistant?

#### Solution 1: Ensure you have enough energy to devote to the problem (Solves Mistake #4)

This is probably the most important factor to have high-quality interactions with AI. Let me remind
you, AI assistants MIRROR your energy. If you provide it with low-quality inputs, it will provide
you with low-quality outputs. It's as simple as that. When your energy is higher, you will naturally
focus on the details, which leads to the next point.

#### Solution 2: Start with small problems (Solves Mistake #3)

Give your AI assistant small fragments to work on. This keeps you from getting overwhelmed or from
missing important details. It provides you with time to critique and give feedback. Give it small
functions to craft, or single tests to write. Starting small will naturally lead to the next point.

#### Solution 3: Craft detailed constraints (Solves Mistake #2)

Giving your AI assistant detailed constraints will result in lower volume, and higher quality of
output. When you craft your prompt to have detailed constraints you are less likely to find yourself
glossing over details and pushing AI through problems you don't quite understand. Having detailed
constraints is a sign of the next point.

#### Solution 4: Use AI to do things you know well (Solves Mistake #1)

Once you have 80-90% of a single, particular task figured out, then you should get AI to complete
it. At this point, this is grunt work, and you should save your time and energy for the _thinking_,
not the _doing_.

### Final thoughts

AI-assisted coding is like pair programming; it doesn't really work unless you are energetic and
engaged with the process, articulating your thoughts, and engaging in the details. If you would like
