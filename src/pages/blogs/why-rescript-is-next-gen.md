Programming languages evolve, and when they do, they fix problems from the past, while feeling familiar. Often the evolution of a language gives you clues about what the problems are for the humans using them, and how they propose to fix them. 

For example, take TypeScript. TypeScript can viewed as an expression of desire, on behalf of the humans using JavaScript, to have more safety in their experience of developing the web, and less surprises in production. 

A longer trend, in the history of JavaScript, has been the addition of functional features. Think lodash, and undesrcore, and even React. These functional paradigms can be viewed as an expression of the desire for code the can be reasoned about more easily, within a sane framework, solving the problem of individualized spaguetti code. Just think, before React there was jQuery, then Backbone along with other small frameworks; this was the norm. It was not functional, it was brittle, and without any real framework to guide development.

Sometimes between each generation of language, you need some intermediary step that makes the transition palatable for developers. That's how I view TypeScript. Most JavaScript developers are now familiar with strong-ish type systems thanks to TypeScript, and that will make the next generation of language after TypeScript that much easier to adopt. So we can thank TypeScript for acting as a bridge between JavaScript and the language that truly fixes it's problems: ReScript.

ReScript is a Next Gen Web Dev language. It fixes the problems of the past, while feeling familiar to JavaScript and TypeScript developers. Where TypeScript, with it's compromises, fails to bring safety to JavaScript, ReScript succeeds. It's type system is strong and compeletes what TypeScript lacks, yet it's familiar with strong type inference, and strong React support. 

There are 4 principles to Next-Gen Web Dev languages. 
* Strong Type System: So that web development can deliver robust applications with confidence
* Language Heritage: There is a strong connection to the past, while addressing those same concerns
* Framework Readiness: They are sufficient to address the present complexity of the web
* Incremental Adoption: They can be adopted incrementally to minimize risk, while moving forward towards the future.

ReScript satisfies each of these principles. ReScript 
* Fixes gaps in TypeScript's type system. if you would like to read about that, see [5 ways ReScript Fixes TypeScript](/blogs/5-ways-rescript-fixes-typescript). 
* Feels like JavaScript and TypeScript; it has great type inference which is why it often feels like vanilla JavaScript.
* It fully supports [React versions (>= v18.0)](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/react/latest/introduction).
* Unlike TypeScript, it can be incorporated depth-first into your project, whereas TypeScript adoption requires a breadth-first approach. This means that you can try it out, by either writing vanilla ReScript code for core functions, utilities, or state management (like redux), or you can write React components and incorporate them one by one. 

In terms of Next-Gen Web Dev candidates for the client, there is no other contender beside ReScript that scores well in each of these 4 principles.
